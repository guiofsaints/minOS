# NextUI Documentation

## Overview

NextUI is a high-performance custom firmware for portable retro gaming devices, primarily targeting the TrimUI family (Brick/Smart Pro). Built on MinUI foundation with a completely rebuilt emulation engine, NextUI delivers modern user experience with low-level optimizations.

## Key Features

- **Ultra-low latency (~20ms)** through advanced threading architecture
- **Dynamic CPU scaling** for optimal power management  
- **Multi-threaded rendering** with OpenGL ES shaders
- **Game time tracking** with SQLite database
- **WiFi integration** with NTP time sync
- **RGB LED control** with customizable patterns
- **PAK system** for modular emulator packages

## System Architecture

NextUI consists of several core components:

- **NextUI** - Main user interface (C + SDL2 + OpenGL, ~2800 LOC)
- **MinArch** - Emulation engine with libretro integration (~7100 LOC)
- **Settings** - Configuration system (C++ with UI components)
- **Common API** - Shared libraries and hardware abstraction
- **Platform Layer** - Hardware-specific implementations

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: C (90%), C++ (8%), Shell (2%)
- **Graphics**: SDL2, OpenGL ES 2.0/3.0, multi-pass shaders
- **Audio**: libsamplerate for high-quality resampling
- **Threading**: pthreads + SDL threads (6+ worker threads)
- **Database**: SQLite3 for game time and battery tracking
- **Build System**: Docker-based cross-compilation

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Status | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **tg5040** | âœ… Primary | TrimUI Smart Pro/Brick |
| **desktop** | ðŸŸ¡ Development | Testing and development only |
